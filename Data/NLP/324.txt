The Trade Desk finishes strong at $30.10 per share after its first day on NASDAQ: Things are looking up for adtech companies on Wall Street   or at least for one of them. The Trade Desk debuted on NASDAQ today at a price of $28.75 per share, up nearly 60 percent from its IPO price of $18. And while there wasn t a dramatic pop, it continued to climb and closed the day at $30.10 per share. That s a good start, particularly considering that adtech companies have struggled recently on the public markets, which has made venture capitalists wary of the industry, as well. Ventura, Calif.-headquartered The Trade Desk, which offers tools for ad buyers, was probably helped by its financials   the company is profitable, with 2015 revenue more than doubling year-over-year, to $113.8 million.Chief Client Officer Brian Stempeck also argued that The Trade Desk stands out because it has built real self-serve technology:  A lot of our people are engineers, building products, and when someone works in client services, they aren t managing ad campaigns   they re teaching others how to run the software.  Looking ahead, Stempeck said The Trade Desk will continue to expand internationally while also building more products for programmatic buying of TV ads. After all, he noted that while most ad dollars are going to TV, most TV advertisers don t have a way to learn how many times they ve shown someone the same ad.  Advertisers can actually show fewer ads, they can be better targeted, the publisher or content owner gets a higher rate because it s so targeted, and it s a better experience for the consumer  because they aren t bombarded repeatedly with the same ad, Stempeck said.
