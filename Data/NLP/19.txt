The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger: Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station  A. If you have ever backed up your phone s contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the device s battery. The concept of  juice-jacking  has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection   perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls. If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phone s battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, a product-recommendation site owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there). Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.
