Pinterest valued at $11B on new round of fund-raising: Less than a year after being valued at $5 billion, Pinterest has joined the 11-digit valuation start-up club. Pinterest, an online scrapbooking service, disclosed on Monday that it raised about $367 million in a new round of financing from new and existing investors. It valued the company at $11 billion, putting the start-up in roughly the same range as the Silicon Valley darling Dropbox and the data analysis company Palantir Technologies. In a regulatory filing, Pinterest disclosed that it could raise as much as $211 million in additional financing, bringing its potential haul to $578 million. That would be on top of the $764 million that the nearly five-year-old start-up has raised in previous rounds. Interest has been so ardent that the start-up has nearly tripled its valuation in just about a year and a half. Pinterest has shown strides in expanding and developing revenue, especially with so-called promoted pins that advertisers can buy. Advertising will continue to be a main focus this year, company executives have said.
