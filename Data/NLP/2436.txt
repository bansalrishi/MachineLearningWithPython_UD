Apple is now the No. 1 smartphone maker in CHina: Apple is famous for setting trends. In China, though, Apple has found success by following one. For years, Apple rivals like Samsung offered large-screen smartphones. Although the bigger phones sold well in China, Apple held off on releasing a similar model, and the country remained a weak spot. But Apple introduced its own versions last September, and now the sales spigot is wide open. The company on Tuesday reported $16.1 billion in revenue from  greater China    which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan   in its first fiscal quarter, up 70 percent from the same period a year ago. Canalys, a research firm, estimates that Apple is now the No. 1 smartphone maker in China. The success in China helped push Apple to a blockbuster first quarter, increasing overall profit to $18 billion and revenue to $74.6 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, the company had profit of $13.1 billion and revenue of $57.6 billion.
