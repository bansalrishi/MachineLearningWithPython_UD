Facebook and Instagram were inaccessible for about an hour Tuesday, but cause was an internal malfunction rather than a cyberattack. Facebook users began reporting problems in gaining access to the social media site on Tuesday morning, Hong Kong time. On Twitter, users posted images of an error message from Facebook that read:   Sorry, something went wrong. We re working on it and we ll get it fixed as soon as we can.   Both Facebook s mobile application and its website were inaccessible. Facebook owns Instagram.   Earlier this evening many people had trouble accessing Facebook and Instagram,   Facebook said from its California headquarters.   This was not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems. We moved quickly to fix the problem, and both services are back to 100 percent for everyone.
