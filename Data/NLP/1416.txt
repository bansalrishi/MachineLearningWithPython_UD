Amazon Updates Its Fire TV and Tablet Offerings: The company on Thursday introduced new versions of its Fire TV products, which plug into television sets to stream content over an Internet connection. Notably, customers can now buy a Fire TV streaming stick or set-top box with a remote control that can find content to watch using voice commands, similar to the new Siri-powered Apple TV unveiled last week. Amazon s voice-controlled assistant is named Alexa. This assistant first appeared in Amazon s wireless speaker, the Echo. You ll be able to speak commands like  Alexa, play  John Wick    to play a movie or  Alexa, how s the weather tomorrow   to load the weather forecast on the TV. But unlike Apple, which raised the starting price of its new Apple TV to $150 (up from $70 for the previous model), Amazon is holding its prices steady. You can get the latest stick for the same $40 as before; the Fire TV streaming stick with a voice remote is $50. The Fire TV set-top box with the new remote is the same price as the previous model: $100. And in another sign of how serious Amazon is about competing for attention in the living room, the retail giant is also bundling the Fire TV set-top box with a game controller for $140. In addition, Amazon has added some cheap tablets to its Fire product family. It is offering a low-end Fire tablet for $50, which can also be bought as a six-pack for $250. This inexpensive tablet has a seven-inch screen, can play movies and load books, apps and games. On top of that, Amazon introduced two new tablets with high-definition screens, called Fire HD, which come in eight inches for $150 and in 10.1 inches for $230. (By comparison, Apple s latest tablets cost $380 to $800.)
